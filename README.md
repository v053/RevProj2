# Data Analysis App
Project 2 - Data Analysis

## Description
This data analysis app is a sample project intended to demonstrate an ability to handle Big Data.

## Technologies
- Scala
- Apache Spark
- Vegas for Scala and Spark
- JDK 1.8
- IntelliJ

## Features
Current features:
- Generate a random dataset of customer orders with 10k entries as a .csv file.
- Read data from the .csv file as a Spark Dataframe.
- Run queries on data to return necessary results.
- Command line interface with interactive login and menu
- Return graphs of analyzed data for clear understanding of data.

Future implementation:
- Apache Hive integration
- Optimization for larger datasets
- Logout in addition to login
- Compatibility with spark-submit

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have installed the correct versions of Scala (2.11.12), Spark (2.4.6) and JDK (1.8).
2. Add JDK and Spark homes to the PATH variables for your system.
3. Download all code files, including build.sbt.
4. Configure IntelliJ or IDE of your choice to work with the appropriate version of JDK.
5. Run from within IDE.

## Usage
Enter menu options into the command line exactly as shown. If you have correctly configured JDK 1.8, graphs showing the data for each question will pop up in a separate window.
